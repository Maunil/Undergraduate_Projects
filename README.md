# My Undergraduate Projects

## 1). 22 Shrutis Synthesizer
**Members : Deep C. Patel, Maunil Vyas, Shreyas Patel, Prof. Ashok Ranade**<br>
The electronic synthesizers in the market are capable of generating 12 notes per octave. But the Indian Classical music identifies 22 notes('Shrutis') per octave. Thus, absence of the electronic synthesizers in the market having this capability motivated us to start this project. Currently we have developed a prototype version using Python. We have created 2 versions of the synthesizer, one version synthesizes the frequencies using re-sampling of the recorded Harmonium note. In the second version, we synthesized frequencies using additive synthesis. We analyzed main frequency components of the harmonium tone using Fourier Transform, and added their harmonics to synthesize various frequencies. Now, we are planning to make standalone synthesizer using RaspberryPi and MIDI Keyboard. Our future task is to improve the sound quality using generative models.

**Course : Wireless Communications**<br>
In this project we tried to reproduce the paper titled ["A nonparametric approach for spectrum sensing using bootstrap techniques"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7036915/).

## 3). Analysis of Traditional CPU Scheduling Algorithms and Real Time CPU Scheduling Algorithms
**Members : Maunil Vyas, Deep C. Patel, Shreyas Patel, Karan Patel**<br>
**Course : Operating Systems**<br>
In this project we have done analysis on the Traditional CPU Scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve(FCFS), Shortest
Remaining Next(SRN), Round Robin(RR), Priority Scheduling(PS) as well as Real Time CPU Scheduling Algorithms like Rate Monotonic Scheduling(RMS) and Earliest Deadline First(EDF) algorithms. We analyzed and compared characteristics like Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, Throughput and Percentage of Deadlines Missed.

## 4). Delta Search Machine : Desktop File Search Engine
**Members : Deep C. Patel, Maunil Vyas, Shreyas Patel, Jay Dangar**<br>
**Course : Data Structures and Algorithms**<br>
We made a desktop file searching using Java. We perform serch on the index of the files in the Desktop. For the indexing task, we utilized inverted index. Our Searching engine features GUI, Search History, Recommendations and Spell Corrections.
